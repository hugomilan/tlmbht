% The inputs to this function are:
% y (vector with the positions in y to get outputs, m). Vector column.
% H (tissue's thickness, m)
% t (time instant to get outputs, s)
% Ts (temperature at x = L, oC)
% Tc (initial condition temperature and also temperature at x = 0, oC)
% k (thermal conductivity, W/K-m)
% p (tissue's density, kg/m3)
% cp (tissue's specific heat, J/K-kg)
% wb (blood's perfusion, s-1)
% pb (blood's density, kg/m3)
% cp (blood's specific heat, J/K-kg)
% Tb (blood's temperature, oC)
% Qm (tissue's metabolic heat, W/m3)
% minf (number of repetition of the index m). If in doubt, chose 50 for
%     fast (and still accurate) results or 500 for more accurate results.

% The outputs of this function are:
% T (temperature at the given positions, oC)
% qy (heat flux in the y direction calculated at the given positions, W/m2)
% phi_a (temperatures calculated using the function phi_a at the given positions, oC)
% qy_phi_a (heat flux in the y direction calculated using the function phi_a at the given positions, W/m2)
% phi_b_tau_b (temperatures calculated using the function phi_b_tau_b at the given positions, oC)
% qy_phi_b_tau_b (heat flux in the y direction calculated using the function phi_b_tau_b at the given positions, W/m2)
%
%
% this algorithm uses the principle of superposition to make
% T = Tc + phi_a(x) + phi_b(x)tau_b(t)
%
%
%
% This algorithm is not intended for wb = 0. For this case, you should use
% D1_HEAT_f
