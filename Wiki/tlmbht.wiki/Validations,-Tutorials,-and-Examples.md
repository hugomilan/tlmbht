Here, you will find links case studies used to validate tlmbht (and the TLM method), examples of simulation problems using tlmbht, and tutorials in how to create case files and run tlmbht. This can also help you get familiarity with the software tlmbht. 

Validations for the diffusion equation, heat equation, and Pennes equation are very similar to each other. That should be enough to go through the tutorial for only one of these equation--chose the one you are more comfortable with.

## Diffusion equation

### Validations

1. [One-dimension using the element line](https://github.com/hugomilan/tlmbht/wiki/Validating-Diffusion-Equation-in-1D-with-line-elements)

2. [Two-dimensions using the element triangle](https://github.com/hugomilan/tlmbht/wiki/Validating-Diffusion-Equation-in-2D-with-triangle-elements)

3. [Three-dimensions using the element tetrahedron](https://github.com/hugomilan/tlmbht/wiki/Validating-Diffusion-Equation-in-3D-with-tetrahedron-elements)
