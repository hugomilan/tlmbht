# TLM Codes

* [SimEMTher](https://github.com/hugomilan/SimEMTher): I wrote this software in Matlab to solve problems of bio-heat propagation in two-dimensions. It has a graphical user interface but it not maintained anymore. License GNU GPL V3.

* [MEFiSTo<sup>TM</sup> Electromagnetic Simulations](http://www.faustcorp.com/): Commercial software to solve 2D and 3D electromagnetic scattering problems using TLM. The 2D version (MEFiSTo-2D Classic) can be obtained free of charge. This software does not seem to be maintained anymore.

* [emGine](http://www.petr-lorenz.com/emgine/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=44&Itemid=53): Free for non-commercial purposes, emGine solves time-domain full-wave 3D electromagnetic problems. It does not seem to be maintained anymore (last update is from 2014). Tri-license MPL/GPL/LGPL.

* [CST](https://www.cst.com/) [TLM solver](https://www.cst.com/products/cstmws/Solvers/TLM-Solver): Active commercial software that provides the TLM solver for electromagnetic simulations.

* [Transmission Line Matrix for Acoustic Simulations](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/661257/transmission-line-matrix-for-acoustic-simulations). This is a implementation by Kenneth Haugland of the TLM method applied to acoustic simulations. The code was written in VB and C#. The license is [The Code Project Open License (CPOL)](https://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx).

Do you another software not listed here? Let me know and I will include it!
