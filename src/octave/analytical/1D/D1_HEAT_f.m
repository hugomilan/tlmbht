% The inputs to this function are:
% y (vector with the positions in y to get outputs, m). Vector column.
% H (material's thickness, m)
% t (time instant to get outputs, s)
% Ts (temperature at x = L, oC)
% Tc (initial condition temperature and also temperature at x = 0, oC)
% k (thermal conductivity, W/K-m)
% p (material's density, kg/m3)
% cp (material's specific heat, J/K-kg)
% Qext (external heat source, W/m3)
% minf (number of repetition of the index m). If in doubt, chose 50 for
%     fast (and still accurate) results or 500 for more accurate results.
%
% The outputs of this function are:
% T (temperature at the given positions, oC)
% qy (heat flux in the y direction calculated at the given positions, W/m2)
% phi_a (temperatures calculated using the function phi_a at the given positions, oC)
% qy_phi_a (heat flux in the y direction calculated using the function phi_a at the given positions, W/m2)
% phi_b_tau_b (temperatures calculated using the function phi_b_tau_b at the given positions, oC)
% qy_phi_b_tau_b (heat flux in the y direction calculated using the function phi_b_tau_b at the given positions, W/m2)

%
% this algorithm uses the principle of superposition to make
% T = Tc + phi_a(x) + phi_b(x)tau_b(t)

% defining constants
alpha = k/(p*cp); % thermal difusivity (m2/s)
theta_inf = Ts - Tc; % boundary condition for solution of phi_a

c1 = ( theta_inf/H + Qext*H/(2*k) ); % constant for solution of phi_a

% solution phi_a(y). The boundary conditions are:
% y = 0 => phi_a = 0.
% y = H => phi_a = theta_inf.
phi_a = -Qext/(2*k)*y.^2 + c1*y;
qy_phi_a = Qext*y - k*c1;

% variable for solution of phi_b(y)tau_b(t). The boundary conditions are: 
% y = 0 => phi_b(y)tau_b(t) = 0.
% y = H => phi_b(y)tau_b(t) = theta_inf.
% The initial condition is: t = 0 => phi_b_tau_b = - phi_a(y).
phi_b_tau_b = zeros(1,size(y,2));
qy_phi_b_tau_b = zeros(1,size(y,2));

for m = 1:minf
    lambda = m*pi/H; % comes from separation of variables. Used for solution of phi_b_tau_b
    
    C3m1 = c1*2/lambda*(-1)^m;
    C3m2 = Qext/(H*k)*( (-1)^m*( 2 - lambda^2*H^2 ) - 2 )/lambda^3;
    
    C3m = C3m1 + C3m2;
    
    phi_b_tau_b = C3m*sin( lambda*y )*exp( -lambda^2*alpha*t ) + phi_b_tau_b;
    qy_phi_b_tau_b = -k*C3m*lambda*cos(lambda*y)*exp( -lambda^2*alpha*t ) + qy_phi_b_tau_b;
    
end



% at the end we sum the solutions.
T = Tc + phi_a + phi_b_tau_b + phi_c;
qy = qy_phi_a + qy_phi_b_tau_b;
