% The inputs to this function are:
% x (vector with the positions in x to get outputs, m). Vector column.
% H (tissue's thickness, m)
% t (time instant to get outputs, s)
% Ts (temperature at x = L, oC)
% Tc (initial condition temperature and also temperature at x = 0, oC)
% k (thermal conductivity, W/K-m)
% p (tissue's density, kg/m3)
% cp (tissue's specific heat, J/K-kg)
% wb (blood's perfusion, s-1)
% pb (blood's density, kg/m3)
% cp (blood's specific heat, J/K-kg)
% Ta (arterial blood temperature, oC)
% Qm (tissue's metabolic heat, W/m3)
% minf (number of repetition of the index m). If in doubt, chose 50 for
%     fast (and still accurate) results or 500 for more accurate results.

% This algorithm is not intended for wb = 0. However, if you input that, we
% will make wb = eps (the minimum value that your computer can use). This
% approximation barely will lead to results different from when wb = 0.
