% The inputs to this function are:
% x (vector with the positions in x to get outputs, m). Vector column.
% L (tissue's thickness, m)
% time (time instant to get outputs, s)
% Tinf (temperature at x = L, oC)
% Ti (initial condition temperature and also temperature at x = 0, oC)
% k (thermal conductivity, W/K-m)
% p (tissue's density, kg/m3)
% cp (tissue's specific heat, J/K-kg)
% tau (thermal relaxation time, or, another definition more appropriated for 
%     biological tissues, "characteristic time needed for accumulating the thermal
%     energy required for propagative transfer to the nearest element within the 
%     nonhomogeneous inner structures", defition from Liu, Chen and Xu, 1999; s)
% wb (blood's perfusion, s-1)
% pb (blood's density, kg/m3)
% cp (blood's specific heat, J/K-kg)
% Ta (arterial blood temperature, oC)
% Qm (tissue's metabolic heat, W/m3)
% Qr (constant external heat, W/m3)
% ninf (number of repetition of the index n). If in doubt, chose 500 for
%     fast (and still accurate) results or 5000 for more accurate results.

% This algorithm is not intended for wb = 0. However, if you input that, we
% will make Wb = eps (the minimum value that your computer can use). This
% approximation barely will lead to results different from when wb = 0.
