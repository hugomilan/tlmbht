Here, you will find tutorials, case studies used to validate tlmbht (and the TLM method), and examples of simulation problems using tlmbht. This can also help you get familiarity with the software tlmbht. 

## Tutorials

1. [TLMBHT workflow]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link vte/how tlmbht.md %})

2. [Running tlmbht in Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link vte/run on windows.md %})

3. [How to configure a case file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link vte/configure case file.md %})



### Validations

Validations for the diffusion equation, heat equation, and Pennes equation are very similar to each other. That should be enough to go through the tutorial for only one of these equation--chose the one you are more comfortable with.

#### Diffusion equation

1. [One-dimension using the element line]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link vte/v diff 1D line.md %})

2. [Two-dimensions using the element triangle](https://github.com/hugomilan/tlmbht/wiki/Validating-Diffusion-Equation-in-2D-with-triangle-elements)

3. [Three-dimensions using the element tetrahedron](https://github.com/hugomilan/tlmbht/wiki/Validating-Diffusion-Equation-in-3D-with-tetrahedron-elements)

#### Heat equation
