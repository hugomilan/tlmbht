This is scientific code used to solve the bioheat equation (BHE; Pennes, 1948; Minkowycz and Sparrow, 2009; Xu et al., 2011) in 2D and 3D problems. The solver is the TLM method and more information is provided below. The language is MATLAB and it does not have graphical interface (yet).

I hope you will find it useful for learning/use the Transmission-line Modeling (TLM) method applied to solve the Bioheat transfer problems. The code developed herein is based in two new nodes that I recently developed for solving the bioheat equation. The nodes are triangular for 2-D problems (Milan and Gebremedhin, 2016a) and tetrahedron for 3-D problems (Milan and Gebremedhin, 2016b). I will provide some theory when the papers get published.

I started developing the TLMBHT in Matlab but I intend to code it in another language. Accompaning the code, follows a code for solving the BHE in 2D and 3D analyticaly for simplified geometries. The geometries are rectangular and cubic. I will discuss them after the papers get published (e-mail me if you need them though).

Please, fell free to use the software for educational, research and non-profit purposes. You can modify it and your modifications can be (if you want to) included into this project.
